# How to Use the Gravitational Force Gizmo to Learn About Gravity
 
The Gravitational Force Gizmo is a virtual lab that allows you to explore the factors that influence the strength of gravitational force between two objects. You can adjust the mass of each object, drag them around, and observe the gravitational force vectors and numerical values. The Gizmo also provides an answer key for some questions and scenarios pertaining to the virtual lab.

To use the Gravitational Force Gizmo, you need to have an account on ExploreLearning.com and access to the Gizmo. You can sign up for a free account or contact them for a quote or demo. Once you have access to the Gizmo, you can launch it from the website or download it to your computer.
 
The Gizmo has four main parts: the simulation window, the control panel, the question panel, and the navigation buttons. The simulation window shows two objects, A and B, with their masses and gravitational force vectors. You can drag the objects around and see how their positions affect the gravitational force. The control panel allows you to change the mass of each object using sliders or text boxes. You can also turn on or off the show force vector checkboxes, which display or hide the arrows representing gravitational force. The question panel contains questions and scenarios that test your understanding of gravitational force. You can click on the question number to see the question, and click on Check Answer to see if you are correct. The navigation buttons allow you to go back or forward through the questions, reset the simulation, or print your results.
 
Some of the concepts you can learn from using the Gravitational Force Gizmo are:
 
- The gravitational force between two objects is proportional to their masses and inversely proportional to the square of their distance.
- The gravitational force is always attractive and acts along the line connecting the centers of mass of the objects.
- The gravitational force is a vector quantity, which means it has both magnitude and direction.
- The gravitational force depends only on mass and distance, not on shape, size, color, or any other property of the objects.
- The gravitational force is one of the four fundamental forces of nature, along with electromagnetic, strong nuclear, and weak nuclear forces.

By using the Gravitational Force Gizmo, you can gain a deeper understanding of how gravity works and how it affects everything in the universe. You can also apply your knowledge to real-world situations involving gravity, such as orbits, tides, weightlessness, and more.
  
If you want to learn more about gravity and its effects, you can try some of the following activities:

- Use the Gizmo to create different scenarios involving gravitational force. For example, you can compare the gravitational force between the Earth and the Moon, the Sun and the Earth, or two planets in the solar system. You can also change the mass or distance of the objects and see how that affects the gravitational force.
- Watch some videos or animations that illustrate how gravity works and how it influences various phenomena. For example, you can watch how gravity causes objects to fall, how gravity bends light around massive objects, or how gravity creates black holes.
- Conduct some experiments or demonstrations that show the effects of gravity. For example, you can drop different objects and measure their acceleration, you can use a pendulum to show how gravity affects motion, or you can use a scale to measure your weight on different planets.
- Read some books or articles that explain the history and science of gravity. For example, you can read about how Isaac Newton discovered the law of universal gravitation, how Albert Einstein developed the theory of general relativity, or how scientists are trying to detect and study gravity waves.

Gravity is one of the most fascinating and important concepts in physics. By using the Gravitational Force Gizmo and other resources, you can explore and appreciate the wonders of gravity and its role in shaping our universe.
